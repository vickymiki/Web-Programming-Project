## Welcome to our final project for CS546 Web Programming I

### Intro

Our group created a restaurant ordering system, where users are able to place orders at their favorite restaurants, leave reviews on their experience, and leave comments and likes on others' reviews! A separate type of user account exists for managers, where they can create restaurants, add food items to their restaurants and complete orders that have been placed by customers.

### Running our Application

To run our application, complete the following steps:

* First, clone our repo
* Next, you will need to seed your database with information provided in our seedAll.js file. To run this, simply use `npm run seed`. This may take a minute or so.
* You're now ready to run the application! Start it up with `npm start` and enjoy our social online restaurnt experience!
